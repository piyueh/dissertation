The later benchmarks of PINNs in this work include some training strategies that have not been reported in literature of PINNs.
These strategies represent some latest development in other deep learning applications beyond PINNs.
We would like to see if these strategies help improve the accuracy or reduce computational cost of data-free PINNs.
