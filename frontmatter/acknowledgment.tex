\acknowledgments{
I sincerely appreciate my wife, Chao-Yi.
My Ph.D. study is a long journey.
She has always been supportive and has never been impatient with my slow progress on this journey.
It is her who always told me to pursue what I like to do.

I have been appreciative of my advisor, Professor Lorena Barba.
She allowed me to explore any interests without worrying about anything.
She was always there to protect students no matter what troubles we encountered.

I am also grateful to all I have met at GW: Olivier, Tingyu, Naty, Gil, Anastasia, Paulina, Aditya, Akash, and so many other friends at GW.
We survived Covid-19 together, and we survived this long journey at GW together.

Finally, thanks to those reading this dissertation.
Thanks to everyone and everything in my life.
The current life is a result of all the events that happened in the past.
These events and all the people I met made me who I am right now.
